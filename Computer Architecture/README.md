Computer Architecture—sometimes called “computer systems” or “computer organization”—is an important first look at computing below the surface of software. In our experience, it’s the most neglected area among self-taught software engineers.

1.) Book

Our favorite introductory book is Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, and a typical introductory computer architecture course using the book would cover most of chapters 1-6 (!).

We love CS:APP for the practical, programmer-oriented approach. While there's much more to computer architecture than what's covered in the book, it serves as a great starting point for those who'd like to understand computer systems primarily in order to write faster, more efficient and more reliable software.
